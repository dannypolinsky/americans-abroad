## Current State (as of 2026-07-27)

**Site is healthy.** All 8 QA checks pass (last run 2026-07-26). Backend v2.7.0, live mode,
fresh scrape, 49 players, container up 2 weeks. Public endpoint HTTP 200, new TLS cert valid
to **Oct 24, 2026**.
- The 5 transfers detected 2026-07-09 have **applied cleanly** — `/api/health` now reports
  `rosterDrift: []` (in-memory roster matches the FotMob baseline), so no pending/wrong drift.
- Only open follow-up: the `participated && rating===null` QA check (see Next Steps).

### 2026-07-26 — Public TLS cert had expired → site looked dead (RESOLVED)

- **Symptom**: site showed no data. **Cause**: the myQNAPcloud Let's Encrypt cert for
  `PolinskyNAS.myqnapcloud.com` **expired Jul 22, 2026** (~4 days). Browsers rejected the TLS
  handshake, so the Ionos frontend couldn't reach the NAS backend. The backend itself was fine
  the whole time (localhost:3001 healthy).
- **Monitor blind spot (now fixed)**: the NAS cron monitor checks the backend from *inside* the
  NAS (localhost:3001), which bypasses the public cert — so it read PASS while users saw a dead
  site. Added a public-cert-expiry check to **both** `monitor.sh` (step 5, logs `cert=ok |
  expiring<14d | EXPIRED | unreachable`) and the QA skill's `qa-check.sh` (new "TLS cert" check,
  warns <14 days out). QA is now 8 checks.
- **Fix**: myQNAPcloud app → SSL Certificate → **Install 90-day SSL** (Let's Encrypt, free).
  Status showed "Not Installed" (expired cert was dropped) — there is **no renew button, you
  reinstall**. New cert valid **Jul 26 → Oct 24, 2026**.
- **Recurrence risk**: QNAP's Let's Encrypt auto-renewal has now lapsed at expiry twice. Do NOT
  rely on it. Watch for `cert=expiring<14d` in monitor.log before **Oct 24, 2026**; reinstall
  the 90-day SSL when it warns. (Or buy the 3-year myQNAPcloud cert to stop the cycle.)
- **SSH-alias gotcha hit this session**: `ssh nas` resolves to the Tailscale IP (100.84.253.80),
  which was unreachable. On home network, SSH directly:
  `ssh -i ~/.ssh/nas_deploy admin@192.168.4.61`.

## Background — v2.7.0 pre-season hardening (2026-07-09)

**Pre-season hardening v2.7.0 DEPLOYED to NAS and healthy.** Confirmed live:
`/api/health` → v2.7.0, scrape fresh, 0 failures, drift check ran (5 detected, day 1/3).
- NAS (primary backend): ✅ v2.7.0 live, healthy
- Ionos (frontend): ✅ redeployed (fresh bundle, HTTP 200) — now ships the `teamFotmobId` roster
- Render (fallback backend): ⏳ not deployed (low priority)
- **5 real transfers detected on the live backend** (below). They auto-apply after 3 consecutive
  daily checks — **review in `/api/health` before then** if any are wrong.

### 2026-07-09 — Pre-season hardening (v2.7.0, built, verified, NOT deployed)

Fable 5 reviewed the project; Opus built the agreed items:

1. **Transfer drift detection + auto-apply** (`matchTrackerFD.js`). Each player now carries a
   `teamFotmobId` (seeded into both `players.json` files as the baseline). A daily
   `checkRosterDrift()` compares FotMob's `primaryTeam.teamId` to that baseline. Mismatches
   log `TRANSFER DETECTED`, are tracked per-day, and surface in `/api/health` → `rosterDrift`.
   After **3 consecutive daily** confirmations it auto-rewrites team/league/teamFotmobId in
   both roster files + appends `data/cache/transferLog.json`.
   - **Durability**: drift state + transfer log live in `data/cache/` (the only Docker volume
     that survives rebuilds). players.json is baked into the image and reverts on rebuild, so
     confirmed transfers are **re-applied to the in-memory roster on startup** from the
     volume-backed drift state. In-memory roster drives all match discovery, so it stays correct.
   - **Live check already flagged 5 real drifts**: Musah→Milan, Turner→Lyon, Paredes→Utrecht,
     Cavan Sullivan→Philadelphia Union II, Dettoni→Bayern München II. All at day 1/3 — they'll
     auto-apply on the deployed backend after 3 daily checks. **Review these in `/api/health`
     before they apply** if any are wrong (the two reserve-team ones are worth a look).
2. **Resilience**: all FotMob fetches now have a 15s `AbortSignal.timeout` + browser UA; polling
   switched from `setInterval` to a self-rescheduling `setTimeout` chain (+ `pollRunning` guard)
   so slow cycles can't overlap and double FotMob traffic.
3. **Scrape health**: `/api/health` now reports `scrape.lastSuccessAt / minutesSinceSuccess /
   consecutiveFailures / stale` (stale = no usable data in 45 min). A `__NEXT_DATA__`-missing
   200 logs `FOTMOB_PAYLOAD_SHAPE_CHANGED`. QA skill gained **Scrape freshness** + **Roster drift** checks.
4. **Julian Hall lineup fix**: `getPlayerLineupStatus` (and recent-match starter/sub detection)
   now match by `fotmobId` first, so name mismatches no longer show `not_in_squad` when starting.
5. **Upgrades**: removed 6 unused backend deps (puppeteer×3, cheerio, fotmob, node-cron),
   regenerated lockfile, `Dockerfile` node 20→22. Deleted `footballData.js` + ~8 dead methods.
6. **Security**: scrubbed the retired `FOOTBALL_DATA_KEY` from `CLAUDE.md` (still deactivate it in
   the football-data.org account — it's in git history).

**Deploy note**: `deploy.sh nas` always rebuilds (`compose up -d --build`), so the dep/Node
changes apply automatically — no `DOCKER_REBUILD` flag needed. Run `/qa-americans-abroad` after.

**Not done (out of agreed scope)**: full roster unification (frontend still bundles its own
players.json copy — auto-apply writes both, but the label only updates on the next frontend
deploy); retiring the `TEAM_IDS` map entirely; the `App.jsx:447` footer text ("updates every
5 minutes" is backwards — it's 60s live). Manual-stats pipeline (`loadManualStats`) is still
loaded-but-unused.

## Recent Changes

### 2026-06-11 — Polling loop error handling (deployed)

- Wrapped `pollForUpdates` in `matchTrackerFD.js` with try/catch — prevents unhandled promise rejections from crashing the server if a runtime bug occurs inside the interval callback

### 2026-06-11 — Codebase refactor (deployed, QA passed)

**Deleted dead files:**
- Removed `backend/services/matchTracker.js`, `apiFootball.js`, `fbrefScraper.js` (~1,200 lines) — none were imported anywhere

**Backend (`backend/services/fotmobService.js`):**
- Extracted `parseGoalAssistCardEvents()` method — replaced three duplicated goal/assist/card parsing loops in `getPlayerStatsFromMatch`, `getPlayerStatsFromTeamLineup`, and `getPlayerRecentMatches`

**Frontend — new utility module:**
- Created `src/utils/playerUtils.js` — all pure helpers consolidated here: display formatters (`abbrevPosition`, `formatDate`, `formatKickoff`, etc.), status classifiers (`getRatingClass`, `getStatusClass`, etc.), and match-data filters (`getMostRecentGameDate`, `hasRecentGame`, `isKickoffToday`, etc.)

**Frontend — App.jsx:**
- Removed 5 inline helper functions that closed over state; they now live in `playerUtils.js` and take `matchData` as an explicit parameter

**Frontend — PlayerCard split (528 → 85 lines):**
- `src/components/StatsStrip.jsx` — pure badge strip (goals, assists, cards, sub events)
- `src/components/StatsModal.jsx` — owns all drag-to-dismiss refs and handlers
- `src/components/TodayMatchSection.jsx` — today's match block
- `src/components/LastGameSection.jsx` — last game + missed game + next game block
- `PlayerCard.jsx` now just orchestrates state and renders sub-components

---

### 2026-05-14 — Refactor + startup performance (deployed, QA passed)

- Removed dead `updateFotMobData()` pipeline (~160 lines)
- Added `lastGameData` disk persistence (`lastGameCache.json`) — backend serves `lastGame` data immediately after any restart
- Added unconditional 5-minute frontend refresh interval (worst-case staleness now 5 min, not indefinite)
- Server version bumped to `2.6.0`

---

## Known Issues / Gotchas

- **Proxy rule wipes (recurring)**: The `/api/` proxy rule in `/etc/app_proxy.conf` has been wiped 3 times by QNAP system events. If the backend goes unreachable, SSH to NAS and check that rule first:
  ```
  ProxyPass /api/ http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/ retry=0
  ProxyPassReverse /api/ http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/
  ```
  Then hard-restart Apache (see `CLAUDE.md` for the kill command).

- **Public TLS cert lapses at expiry (recurring)**: QNAP's myQNAPcloud Let's Encrypt cert has
  expired twice now without auto-renewing. When it lapses, the site looks dead to users while
  the backend stays healthy (checks that hit localhost pass). Both `qa-check.sh` and NAS
  `monitor.sh` now flag it (`cert=expiring<14d | EXPIRED`). Fix: myQNAPcloud app → SSL
  Certificate → **Install 90-day SSL** (no renew button — reinstall). **Next expiry: Oct 24,
  2026.** A paid 3-year myQNAPcloud cert would end the cycle.

---

## Next Steps

- **Treat a played-but-unrated match as suspect, not "upstream is just late."** Danny's stance:
  if a player has `participated: true` but `rating: null`, assume something may be broken and
  investigate rather than shrugging it off. Worth building: a QA/health check that flags any
  player with `participated && rating === null`, so these surface automatically.
  - Current example (2026-07-09): Rokas Pukstas (id 74) played 90' in Hajduk Split 2–0 Žilina
    (Europa League qualifier, fixture 5786501) with `rating: null`. Verified this time it's a
    genuine FotMob gap — **0 of 44 players in that match were rated** — and the today-match path
    re-fetches each poll, so it should fill in when FotMob rates it. But per the stance above,
    re-check it filled in, and don't assume the next null is also upstream.
- Render fallback still not deployed (low priority, has cold starts)
- **Before Oct 24, 2026**: reinstall the 90-day SSL cert when `monitor.log` shows
  `cert=expiring<14d` (see Known Issues). Auto-renewal cannot be trusted.

### Done this session (2026-07-26)
- Added public-cert-expiry monitoring to `qa-check.sh` (new "TLS cert" check, QA now 8 checks)
  and NAS `monitor.sh` (step 5, logs `cert=`; old script backed up to `monitor.sh.bak`).

---

## Key Reminders

- **NAS deploy**: `./deploy.sh nas` — works on home network (192.168.4.61) *or* over Tailscale (auto-falls back to 100.84.253.80 when the local IP is unreachable; disconnect NordVPN first)
- **`ssh nas` alias points to Tailscale (100.84.253.80)** — unreachable on home network without Tailscale up. For ad-hoc NAS commands on home network, SSH directly: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/nas_deploy admin@192.168.4.61`
- **Force client cache clear**: bump `CACHE_VERSION` in `src/App.jsx` (currently `'4'`)
- **Do NOT use the global deploy skill** — it syncs project root and corrupts the container; always use project-local `./deploy.sh nas`
- Lineup status only shows for upcoming games within 45 min of kickoff
- Julian Hall's FotMob name is "Julian Zakrzewski" — ID-based matching handles this automatically
